<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Onkar Tummanpalli</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Data Scientist from India</h3>

### Glad to see you here!
I am a motivated, team-work oriented and an experienced Data Scientist who takes pride in building models that translate data points into business insights. Interested in working on projects offering learning and understanding in the fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Big Data Analytics and Data Visualization.                                                                                                               
Please find below list of some of the interesting projects I have worked on. For complete list please check other repositories.        

# Speech to Text conversion : 
Worked on speech detection problems.
Converted IVR audio clips to text.
Trained Deepspeech model on IVR dataset and converted speecg to text.

# Predictive maintenance of conveyor motors :
Worked on Atos Digital-Twin Platform for ML related tasks.
Created POC for General Motors for predictive maintenance of conveyor motors.
Goal : to predict if a conveyor motor is going to fail or not.
Created Anomaly detection model and created alerts for the same in the system.
Deployed in IBM cloud using Watson Machine Learning studio.

# Sentiment Analysis of legal documents: (NLP) :
Created a machine learning model to detect sentiment of legal documents which is used in KYC refreshment process for corporates.
Used Zero-Shot-Sequence-Classifier based on pre-trained NLI model to generate sentiments.
Extracted important keywords from documents using KeyBERT.
Created a flask app and deployed in Microsoft Azure cloud.

# Data Science Salary Estimator : (Web Scapping and Regression Techniques) 
â€¢ Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.                                  â€¢ Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium.  
â€¢	Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.  
â€¢	Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.                            
â€¢	Built a client facing API using flask.

# Human Activity Recognition : (Classification Techniques) :
â€¢	This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, 
  Sitting, Standing or Laying.                                                                      
â€¢	The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in Smartphone which is attached
  to 30 different persons performing different activities.Dataset is available at  UCI machine learning repository.                   
â€¢	Applied various classification techniques like Decision Tree, Random Forest,Support Vector Machines and achieved accuracy of
  more than 90 %.                                                                                                    

# Quora-Question-Pair Similarity: (Natural Language Processing) :
â€¢	Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions.
  Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question.          
â€¢	The dataset can be found on Kaggle. Main aim of project is that predict whether pair of questions are similar or not.            
â€¢	Applied Text preprocessing, feature extraction, feature vector generation using tf-idf,word2vec, glove and 
  fuzzy logic implementation.                                                                                                       
â€¢	Applied logistic regression and Support Vector Machine to predict if a pair of questions are similar or not.

# Recommendation System : (Deep learning â€“ Convolutional Neural Network) :
â€¢	Created recommendation system on fashion apparel dataset (Amazon) to generate product recommendations using title of the product.   
â€¢	After pre-processing text, used BoW and TF-IDF model to generate feature embeddings.                                               
â€¢	Performed deep learning based visual similarity on convolutional neural network with the help of transfer learning using VGG-16.    

# Intelligent Replier System : (Natural Language Processing) :
â€¢	Accessed emails (from Gmail account) using GMAIL API in Python.                                                                    
â€¢	Applied text pre- processing and then passed email body to Googleâ€™s Universal Sentence Encoder to generate embeddings.              
â€¢	Created pipeline with the help of Apache Beam.                                                                                      
â€¢	Found similar emails using Spotifyâ€™s ANNOY model and replied to email.                                                             

# Image Verification Tool: (Flask API and OpenCV) :
â€¢	Created web application for image verification (used OpenCV) and deployed on Google Cloud Platform.                                
â€¢	User uploaded images (Registration Folder) are compared with Verification (Verification Folder) images.                             
â€¢	Structural Similarity Score(SSIM) is calculated and if its greater than threshold, images are declared to be identical.
